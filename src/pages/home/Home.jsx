              True one-to-one customer engagement sounds good in theory, but many marketers aren’t sure how to actually get there. Enter AI. Used wisely, artificial intelligence yields a deeper understanding of customers across different contexts and channels. 

                AI can read signals and sense your customer’s unique intent – to purchase, to upgrade, and even to cancel – before she acts. Powered by real-time data, AI can serve up unique, relevant offers automatically, or guide customer-service reps (CSRs) to make the right offer at the right time. In highly regulated industries, AI can also be an invaluable transparency tool to demonstrate why you are presenting particular offers to specific customers and prove that no unconscious bias is at work.
